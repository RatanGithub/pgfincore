make clean && make && sudo make install

Create the functions from the sql script (it should be in your contrib directory)

select relname,block_mem,size,(block_mem*4*1024*100/size)||' %'  as ratio_memory from (select relname, pgfincore_name(relname) as block_mem, pg_relation_size(relname) as size from pg_stat_user_tables ) s;

Enjoy ;)
