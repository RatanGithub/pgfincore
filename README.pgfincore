make clean && make && sudo make install

Create the functions from the sql script (it should be in your contrib directory)

select relname, 
       pg_size_pretty(size) as size, 
       size/4/1024 as block_disk,
       block_mem, 
       (block_mem*4*1024*100/size)||' %'  as block_ratio 
from (select relname, 
             pgfincore(relname) as block_mem, 
             pg_relation_size(relname) as size 
      from pg_stat_user_tables ) s
order by 3 desc;

Enjoy ;)
